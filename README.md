# 🧠 LangChain Prompt Practice

This repository contains my basic practice with **LangChain's prompt engineering** and chatbot structure using core components like `ChatPromptTemplate`, message handling, and UI simulation.

## 📁 Files Overview

- `chat_prompt_template.py` – Practice with LangChain's `ChatPromptTemplate` for creating dynamic prompts. Use `chat_history.txt` as a database to get the history.
- `chatbot.py` – A basic chatbot implementation using LangChain components.
- `message_placeholder.py` – Practice using `MessagesPlaceholder` for injecting messages into the prompt.
- `messages.py` – Experiments with `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, and `AIMessage`.
- `prompt_ui.py` – A simple script mimicking a prompt interface for testing conversation flows. Also use `template` to check reusability.
